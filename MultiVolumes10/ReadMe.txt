
Multi-Volumes for ArcGIS 10 and 10.1


This tool will loop the surface volume tool in ArcToolbox 
(3D Analyst-Functional Surface-Surface Volumes) 
for a user-defined range of values and graduations.

Given a surface and an elevation graduation value, 
this tool will calculate the surface area, the volume, 
and the 3-D surface area at each graduation.  The data 
from each graduation are written to a comma delimited text 
file.

Input Parameters
1. A surface model. (raster or TIN)
2. An output text file to store results as a comma delimited text file.
3. Whether you want to calculate above or below your starting elevation value.
4. The starting elevation in surface model z units.
5. Z value scalar.
6. The graduation value in surface model z units.
7. The elevation to stop the calculations.


This tool has been tested on ArcGIS 10 and 10.1 and requires the 3-D Analyst extension.
